# Digit Recogniser
This project trains neural networks to be able to recognise and identify handwritten digits in images. The MNIST dataset contains thousands of labelled images of handwritten digits. This data is used to train the networks, and the results are submitted to Kaggle. The best results are achieved with a convolutional network, which achieves ~97% accuracy.
